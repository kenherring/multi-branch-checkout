# Multi Branch Checkout - VSCode Extension

This extension allows for checking out multiple branches simultaneously by leveaging  the [`git worktree`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) feature.

* Easily stage code changes to a different branch
* Quickly switch between working sets, without stashing
* Visually organize changes into multiple branches/PRs
* Copy or move partial changes to a different branch

When working through tasks I often find myself making minor changes which are not directly related to the goals
of that task.  This extension makes it incredibly easy to move those changes to a different branch and submit
clean PRs for review.  Then I can follow up with a PR specific to those minor changes when ready.

Be kind to you reviewers, keep your PRs focused and clean! ðŸ§¹
